		<p> In fact, I really started my coding journey with HTML, and quickly switched to another programming language. Coming back to this shows the importance of mastering this beautiful language, right?</p>
		<h2> The journey </h2>

		<p> Years back; I started a journey in coding and programming, why? well I wanted to extend my skills.</p>
		<p> The thing that went wrong was probably me not being able to visualize this on the long run.</p>

		<p> The truth is back then, I have never visualized myself as someone working in tech, as my first choice was Economics and Finance as a field of study </p>
